## INTRODUCTION

This dataset, analyzed in Tableau, explores the relationship between diabetes and various health factors such as BMI, HbA1c levels, blood glucose levels, smoking history, hypertension, and heart disease. 

Using interactive visualizations, we uncover key insights, including the impact of age, lifestyle, and medical history on diabetes prevalence. 

The dashboard includes bar charts, heatmaps, and trend lines, providing a clear understanding of risk factors and patterns in the dataset


### AIM

The aim of this analysis in Tableau is to explore the relationship between diabetes and key health factors such as BMI, blood glucose levels, HbA1c levels, smoking history, hypertension, and heart disease. 

By visualizing trends and patterns, we aim to identify potential risk factors and provide insights that can help in early detection and prevention of diabetes.

## INSIGHTS

üìà BMI Over the Years

* BMI count was highest in 2019.
* After 2019, BMI data drops to zero, maybe due to missing data.
* BMI was stable before 2019.

üö¨ Smoking & Diabetes

* People who never smoked or have no info show more diabetes cases.
* Current and ever smokers show fewer diabetes cases.

‚ù§Ô∏è Smoking, Heart Disease & Diabetes

* Former smokers have the most heart disease cases.
* Diabetes is also high for never smokers.
* Not current smokers have the least risk.

üîç Smoking Categories

* Most people are non-smokers or missing smoking info.
* Fewer people are current or former smokers.

üë• Gender Breakdown

* Females are the largest group.
* Males are second.
* Other gender is very small.

  ## CONCLUSION

* BMI levels peaked in 2019 but dropped drastically afterward, suggesting a data gap or a change in trends.

* Non-smokers and unknown smoking history groups show higher diabetes rates, which could indicate underreported smoking habits or other health factors.

* Former smokers are at higher risk of heart disease, highlighting the long-term effects of smoking.

* The majority of individuals are female, suggesting either sampling bias or higher reporting among females.

* Smoking history and gender play a key role in diabetes and heart disease trends.
